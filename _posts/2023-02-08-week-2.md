In week two I leanred about OOP concepts such as **class,object and inheritence**. Class, Object, and Inheritance are core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). 

```
A Class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that an object of that class will have. An Object is an instance of a class, created by calling the class as a function.

class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year

    def start_engine(self):
        print("Engine started.")

# Create an object of the Car class
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2020)

# Access attributes of the object
print("Make:", my_car.make)
print("Model:", my_car.model)
print("Year:", my_car.year)

# Call a method of the object
my_car.start_engine()git add .
```
 Each object created from a class will have its own unique set of attributes and methods.
 
 Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class to inherit the attributes and methods of an existing class. The new class, known as the child class, can add new attributes and methods or override the ones inherited from the parent class. This allows for code reusability and helps to keep the code organized and maintainable.
