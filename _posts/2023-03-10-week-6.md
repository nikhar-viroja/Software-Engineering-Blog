In week six I Learned about array and created a small project with OOPS concepts.

**Array**
In Python, an array is a collection of elements that are of the same data type and organized in a specific way. An array is a data structure that can be used to store a fixed-size sequence of elements that are all of the same type.

In Python, there are different ways to represent arrays, including:

Lists: Python lists are a built-in data type that can be used as a simple array. Lists can store elements of different data types and can be resized dynamically.

Numpy Arrays: The NumPy library provides a more powerful array data structure that is optimized for numerical operations. NumPy arrays can be multi-dimensional, meaning they can store data in a grid-like structure.

Arrays in Python can be accessed and manipulated using indexing and slicing. Indexing is used to retrieve a specific element from the array, while slicing is used to extract a subset of the array.

Arrays are useful for storing and manipulating large amounts of data efficiently. They can be used in many different applications, including scientific computing, machine learning, and data analysis.

```
# Create a 1-dimensional array with 5 elements
my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Print the array
print(my_array)

# Access elements in the array
print(my_array[2])  

# Slicing the array
print(my_array[:3])  
print(my_array[3:])  
print(my_array[1:4])  

```

**OOPS Project**

```
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def get_name(self):
        return self.name

    def get_age(self):
        return self.age


class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, age, grade):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.grade = grade

    def get_grade(self):
        return self.grade


class Teacher(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, age, subject):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.subject = subject

    def get_subject(self):
        return self.subject


# Create a student and a teacher object
student = Student("John", 16, "A")
teacher = Teacher("Ms. Smith", 35, "Math")

# Print information about the student and teacher
print("Student name:", student.get_name())
print("Student age:", student.get_age())
print("Student grade:", student.get_grade())
print("Teacher name:", teacher.get_name())
print("Teacher age:", teacher.get_age())
print("Teacher subject:", teacher.get_subject())

```
In this example, we're defining three classes: Person, Student, and Teacher. Student and Teacher are subclasses of Person, which means they inherit the properties and methods of the Person class.

Each class has a constructor that takes in one or more arguments and initializes instance variables. Each class also has one or more methods that can be used to get information about the object.

We're then creating a Student object and a Teacher object, and calling their methods to print information about them.

This is just a small example of how object-oriented programming can be used in Python. Object-oriented programming is a powerful paradigm that can be used to create complex and efficient programs.

I was having trouble in oops concepts before but with help of the proper resources and guidence from my friends i overcame this problem and created a small project with oops concept.
