In week Five I learned about Dictionaries, Regular Expressions, Modules and packages. Here are the exaples of the folowing.

**Dictionaries**

I learned how to use dictionaries in Python, how to create them, and how to manipulate their keys and values.

```
my_dict = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2', 'key3': 'value3'}
print(my_dict['key1'])  # Output: 'value1'
my_dict['key4'] = 'value4'
print(my_dict)  # Output: {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2', 'key3': 'value3', 'key4': 'value4'}

```

**Modules and Packages**

I learned how to create your own modules and packages in Python, and how to use them in your programs.

```
# mymodule.py
def my_function():
    print("Hello from my function")

# myprogram.py
import mymodule
mymodule.my_function()  # Output: "Hello from my function"

```

**Regular Expressions**

```
import re

text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
pattern = "brown"
match = re.search(pattern, text)
print(match.start(), match.end())  # Output: 10 15

```
