In week four I learned about topics such as Exceptions, find and replace, input and output, writing to a file. Here the examples and the explanation of those topics.

**Exceptions**
Exceptions are a way to handle errors that may occur during program execution. They allow you to gracefully handle errors and prevent the program from crashing. Here's an example of an exception in Python:

```
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    print(num)
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")
```

**Find and Replace**
In this example, we use regular expressions (regex) to find and replace text in a string. We first import the built-in re module, which provides support for regex in Python.

We define a string variable called text that contains the sentence "Hello, my name is Alice. What's your name?" We then use the findall() function from the re module to find all occurrences of the word "name" in the text. We use the regular expression pattern r"name", which matches the exact string "name".

The findall() function returns a list of all matches found in the text, which in this case is ['name', 'name'].

We then use the sub() function from the re module to replace all occurrences of "name" with "nickname" in the original text. The sub() function takes three arguments: the regex pattern to search for, the replacement text, and the original text. In this case, we use r"name" as the pattern to search for, "nickname" as the replacement text, and text as the original text.

Finally, we print the values of matches and new_text to the console, which output ['name', 'name'] and "Hello, my nickname is Alice. What's your nickname?", respectively. This example demonstrates how to use regular expressions to manipulate text data in Python.

**Input and output**

In this example, we use the built-in input() function to read input from the user. We prompt the user with the question "What's your name?" and store their response in a variable called name. We then use an f-string to print a greeting message that includes the user's name.

```
name = input("What's your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

```

**writing to a file**

In this example, we use the built-in open() function to create a new file called "output.txt" in write mode. We then use the file object's write() method to write the string "Hello, world!" to the file. Finally, we use a with statement to ensure that the file is closed properly when we're done writing to it.

```
with open("output.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello, world!")

```
