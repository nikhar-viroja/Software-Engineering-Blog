This week I started my journey in python. Python is a high-level programming language that is widely used for various applications such as web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more. In this blog, we'll take a look at some of the basic concepts that I will be learning in Python. 

 Conditional statements: Conditional statements are used to execute code based on certain conditions. The if-elif-else statement is a common construct used in Python to implement conditional logic.

 Loops: Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code. Python supports two types of loops: for and while. The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence of elements, and the while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.

 Functions: Functions are used to encapsulate blocks of code that perform a specific task. In Python, functions are defined using the def keyword, and can be called by passing parameters to them. 

 Data structures: Python provides several built-in data structures such as lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. Lists are used to store ordered collections of elements, tuples are used to store ordered and immutable collections of elements, sets are used to store unordered collections of unique elements, and dictionaries are used to store key-value pairs.
