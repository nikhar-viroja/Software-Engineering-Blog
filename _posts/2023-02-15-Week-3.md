In week three I leanred about the remaining concepts of OOP i.e **Polymorphism and Encapsulation** with their examples.

**Polymorphism**

Polymorphism refers to the ability of an object to take on many forms. In Python, this means that an object can have different behaviors or attributes depending on the context in which it is used. This can be achieved through a variety of techniques, including method overriding, operator overloading, and duck typing. Polymorphism allows developers to write more flexible and reusable code, since the same code can be applied to different types of objects.

class Shape:
    def area(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2

shapes = [Rectangle(5, 10), Circle(7)]
for shape in shapes:
    print(shape.area())

**Encapsulation**

Encapsulation is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object from the outside world, and only exposing a public interface that can be used to interact with the object. In Python, encapsulation is achieved through the use of private and protected attributes and methods. Private attributes and methods are denoted by a double underscore prefix, which causes them to be name-mangled and therefore inaccessible from outside the object. Protected attributes and methods are denoted by a single underscore prefix, which indicates that they should not be accessed from outside the object, but can still be accessed if needed.

class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.__balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.__balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if self.__balance < amount:
            print("Insufficient funds")
        else:
            self.__balance -= amount

my_account = BankAccount(1000)
my_account.deposit(500)
my_account.withdraw(200)
print(my_account.__balance) # this will result in an AttributeError since __balance is a private attribute

The init constructer is something that I faced difficulty learning in as init fuction whcih is a constructor in python has specific method that it uses. However through trail and error i have leaned how to actually implement and the working process of this function. Along with this I have also done one more exapmle of each topic.
