Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.

Python is a very diversed language, easy to understand and i had experience in python with django framework during my internship program and i was amazed with the wonder this language can do in most of the fileds. 
As my main goal is to become a full stack web developer i want to become an expert in Python language.
